Description: Performs initial system setup work
 This package contains scripts and configurations to support the Mendel
 Development Tool.
 .
 There is no single daemon for MDT, just a bunch of configuration. Removing this
 package will remove the configurations associated with it and effectively
 disable the ability to use the MDT with this machine.
